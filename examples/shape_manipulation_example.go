		The following code contains examples of how to used Tensor-Go's shape manipulation functions
		to alter the shape of a Tensor.

		The following functions are covered:

		- Partial()
		- Reshape()
		- Transpose()
		- Concat()
		- Permute_Shape()
		- Extend_Shape()
		Extend_Dim()
		- Remove_Dim()
		- Remove_Singletons()
		- Add_Singleton()

		NOTE: Unlike many of the other functions in this library, these functions do not neccesarilly
		have a batched version.

	A = A.Remove_Singletons()
	fmt.Println("\nRemoved Singletons: ", A.Shape)

	// Let's swap the second and fourth dimension by first using Permute_Shape() to get a slice representing
	// The reordering of the dimensions. Then we can use the Transpose() function to apply the reording to the
	// underlying contiguous memory.

	// Let's apply a Reshape(). It's important to NOTE that the Reshape() function does not change the underlying
	// contiguous memory. It only changes the shape me of the Tensor. The product of the shape must be the same
	// as that of the original shape.
	A = A.Reshape([]int{6, 5, 42}, false) // <-- NOTE: Reshape() has batching capabilities

	// which each element of that dim is a copy of the original Tensor

	// elements of the preexisting first dimmension.
