## Supported Features
- Operations on Tensors of n dimmensions
- Neural Networks 
- Reverse Mode Autodiff for Backpropgation
- Linear Algebra Operations


## Setup
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To set up this use this package in your own project, first install the package using the following command:

    go get github.com/Holindauer/Tensor-Go

Then import the package into your project:

    import . "github.com/Holindauer/Tensor-Go/TensorGo"

Don't forget the . before the import statement. This allows you to call the functions and methods in this package without having to specify the package name.
